Tender Management System

Whenever a company requires a service/merchandise, a tender is floated. The
company maintains an empaneled list of Vendors. An empaneled vendor can only bid
for a tender. Every vendor can bid only once against each tender. Against each tender,
there may be bids from several vendors. The company will then select the most suitable
bid and places the order with that vendor
